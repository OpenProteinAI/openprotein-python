    Parameters
    ----------
    session : APISession
        The current API session for communication with the server.
    design_job : DesignJobCreate
        The details of the design job to be created, with the following parameters:
        - assay_id: The ID for the assay.
        - criteria: Criteria for evaluating the design.
        - num_steps: The number of steps in the genetic algo. Default is 8.
        - pop_size: The population size for the genetic algo. Default is None.
        - n_offsprings: The number of offspring for the genetic algo. Default is None.
        - crossover_prob: The crossover probability for the genetic algo. Default is None.
        - crossover_prob_pointwise: The pointwise crossover probability for the genetic algo. Default is None.
        - mutation_average_mutations_per_seq: The average number of mutations per sequence. Default is None.
        - allowed_tokens: A dict of positions and allows tokens (e.g. *{1:['G','L']})* ) designating how mutations may occur. Default is None.
