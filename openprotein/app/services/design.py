        Start a protein design job based on your assaydata, a trained ML model and Criteria (specified here).

        Parameters
        ----------
        design_job : DesignJobCreate
            The details of the design job to be created, with the following parameters:
            - assay_id: The ID for the assay.
            - criteria: Criteria for evaluating the design.
            - num_steps: The number of steps in the genetic algo. Default is 8.
            - pop_size: The population size for the genetic algo. Default is None.
            - n_offsprings: The number of offspring for the genetic algo. Default is None.
            - crossover_prob: The crossover probability for the genetic algo. Default is None.
            - crossover_prob_pointwise: The pointwise crossover probability for the genetic algo. Default is None.
            - mutation_average_mutations_per_seq: The average number of mutations per sequence. Default is None.
            - allowed_tokens: A dict of positions and allows tokens (e.g. *{1:['G','L']})* ) designating how mutations may occur. Default is None.

        DesignFuture
            The created job as a DesignFuture instance.
